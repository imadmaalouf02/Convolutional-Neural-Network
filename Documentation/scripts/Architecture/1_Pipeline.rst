  PyTorch is a powerful open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It provides a flexible and intuitive framework for building, training, and deploying deep learning models. PyTorch stands out for its dynamic computation graph mechanism, allowing for efficient gradient computation and enabling users to define and modify models on-the-fly.

    A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that forms the foundation of various artificial intelligence applications such as computer vision, forecasting, and speech recognition. It consists of multiple layers of neurons, with each layer being activated based on inputs from the previous layer. These layers are interconnected by weights and biases, which determine how information flows through the network. While neural networks are often compared to biological neural networks found in the brain, it's important to exercise caution when making such comparisons, as artificial neural networks are simplified representations designed for specific computational tasks.

    The first layer is the input layer. Input layer activations come from the input to the neural network. The final layer is the output layer. The activations in the output layer are the output of the neural network. The layers in between are called hidden layers.
